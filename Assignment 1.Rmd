This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The following code chunk will import the data from the URL
```{r}
temp<-tempfile()
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",temp)
data<-read.csv(unz(temp,"activity.csv"))
unlink(temp)
```

The following code will process the data into a suitable format for analysis
```{r}
head(data)
dim(data)
str(data)
summary(data$interval)
data$date<-as.Date(data$date)
summary(data$date)
class(data$date)
```
The following code will respond to the question "What is mean total number of steps taken per day?"
But first, let's calculate the number of steps per day...
```{r}
steps1<-aggregate(data$steps~data$date,FUN=mean)
# Number of intervals recorded in a single day
data$dummy<-rep(1,nrow(data))
# Confirm number of intervals in a day
interval1<-aggregate(data$interval~data$date,FUN=sum)
unique(interval1[,2]) # The number of intervals is the same for each day in the datset
steps.per.day<-mean(interval1[,2])*steps1[,2]
```
Now, a histogram of the number of steps taken per day
```{r}
hist(steps.per.day,breaks=20,xlab="Steps taken in a day")
```

... and the mean and median of the number of steps per day
```{r}
mean(steps.per.day)
median(steps.per.day)
```
Now, let's look at the daily activity pattern
```{r}
dap<-aggregate(data$steps~data$interval,FUN=mean)
View(dap)
plot(dap[,1],dap[,2],type="l",xlab="Time of day",ylab="Average number of steps in 5 mins")
```
And the time of the day that records the maximum number of steps is
```{r}
dap[which.max(dap[,2]),1]
```
Inputing missing values
First, number of missing values
```{r}
miss<-which(is.na(data$steps))
length(miss)
```
Second, create copy of dataset and imput missing steps values into it
```{r}
data1<-data
for(i in miss){
  data1$steps[i]<-dap[which(dap[,1]==data1$interval[i]),2]
}
```
... and get historgram of number of steps taken per day and summary statistics
```{r}
# Create table with number of steps taken per day with dataset with filled-in missing values
steps1.1<-aggregate(data1$steps~data1$date,FUN=mean)
steps.per.day1<-mean(interval1[,2])*steps1.1[,2]
hist(steps.per.day1,breaks=20)
mean(steps.per.day1)
median(steps.per.day1)
```
The mean and the median are now the same, after inputing step missing values with the mean of the interval where the missing values were.

Now, let's see if there are differences between weekdays and weekends
```{r}
# Create factor of weekday or weekend on data with filled-in values
dap1<-aggregate(data1$steps~data1$interval,FUN=mean)
data1$weekdy<-rep("Weekday",nrow(data1))
data1$weekdy[which(weekdays(data1$date)=="Sunday"|weekdays(data1$date)=="Saturday")]<-"Weekend"

#Compute mean for each interval, depending on whether this is a weekday or weekend day
dow<-subset(data1,weekdy=="Weekday")
wknd<-subset(data1,weekdy=="Weekend")
dow1<-as.data.frame(aggregate(steps~interval,FUN=mean,data=dow))
wknd1<-as.data.frame(aggregate(steps~interval,FUN=mean,data=wknd))
names(dow1)<-c("interval","mean.steps")
dow1$weekdy<-"Weekdays"
names(wknd1)<-c("interval","mean.steps")
wknd1$weekdy<-"Weekend"
#Combine weekday and weekend dataframes
int.steps<-rbind(dow1,wknd1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Create plot
library(lattice)
xyplot(mean.steps~interval|weekdy,type="l",data=int.steps,layout=c(1,2))
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
